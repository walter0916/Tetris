In Tetris, the player will be prompted to select a difficulty ranging from easy to hard. Then based on that difficulty tetrominos will spawn and fall at a set interval. The objective of the game is to complete rows by placing the tetrominos using the left and right arrow key. The game ends when a new tetromino can no longer spawn without touching an old tetromino 

## Why I Picked This Game 

Outside of just the nostalgia of Tetris I wanted to challenge myself to build a game that forced me to use methods that I am not well versed in so that I can gauge where my skillset lies.

Add levels to the game and a database to store the high scores. I would also like to change the background to have moving objects as well as depth for a more immersive user experience
